# SQL Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured learning of SQL from basics to advanced concepts.

Topics covered:
- SELECT queries and data filtering
- Aggregations and GROUP BY
- Joins and subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions

This repository focuses on SQL fundamentals and interview-relevant practice.
Real-world datasets and projects will be added in separate project repositories.
