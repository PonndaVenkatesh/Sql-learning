# SQL Learning

This repository contains my daily SQL practice as I learn SQL from scratch.

Topics I will cover:
- Basic SELECT queries
- Filtering and sorting data
- Aggregations and GROUP BY
- Joins and subqueries
- Window functions (later)

I will update this repository regularly as I learn new concepts.
